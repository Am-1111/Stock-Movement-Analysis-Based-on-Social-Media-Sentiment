# Stock Movement Analysis Using Social Media Sentiment

This notebook performs stock movement prediction using sentiment analysis from Twitter data. The following steps are implemented:

1. **Data Scraping**:
   - Scrape historical tweets using the `GetOldTweets3` library.
   - Fetch historical stock prices using the `yfinance` library.

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**:
   - Clean tweets (remove punctuation, stopwords, hyperlinks, etc.).
   - Perform sentiment analysis using the `VADER` sentiment analyzer.
   - Extract additional features like tweet volume, sentiment trends, and stock-specific keywords.

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Predict stock prices using Random Forest and Support Vector Regression (SVR).
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize sentiment trends, stock price predictions, and feature importance.
