# Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment

This project predicts stock movements using sentiment analysis of social media data (Twitter) and stock price data. 

## Features
1. Data Scraping
   - Tweets: Scraped using `GetOldTweets3` (or simulated in the notebook).
   - Stock Prices: Fetched using `yfinance`.
2. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
   - Cleaning tweets (stopwords, punctuation, hyperlinks removed).
   - Sentiment analysis using `VADER` sentiment analyzer.
   - Feature extraction: Tweet volume, sentiment trends, etc.
3. Prediction Models
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
4. Evaluation
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
   - Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices and feature importance.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `yfinance`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
